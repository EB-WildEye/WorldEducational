# World Educational Inequality and Unemployment Analysis



## Overview

This project explores the relationship between educational inequality and unemployment across different countries, focusing on how gender disparities in high school completion affect unemployment rates.



## Objectives

- Analyze the gender gap in high school completion rates worldwide.
- Determine if a larger gender gap in education is linked to higher unemployment rates.
- Provide insights that could help address educational and employment inequalities.



## Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: Countries with a larger gender gap in high school completion have higher unemployment rates.



## Data Sources

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes:

- **Gender-wise high school completion rates** across different countries.
- **Country-level unemployment rates**.



## Methodology
